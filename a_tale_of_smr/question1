we tried for 1year smartctl and even seagate own binaries to get some stats on those devices, temperatures, trim support, real util, so far no luck.

feel free to query the linux os and zfs , readonly commands only u can do them without confirming with me if no danger,
as the smr cliff is there and i dont know how long till there
your thoughts
